So, whilst I put my heart into drawing, it gets help from time to time. I have a natural affinity to science and the human body, but I tend to just love subjects that resonate in the real world. I like my work to hinge on a strong idea and the concept usually drives it, helped by a splash of colour. My illustration spans across editorial & advertising, working with the likes of The Washington Post, The Financial Times, Adobe, WeTransfer and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, among others.",

      "I am an illustrator and graphic designer, based in Lithuania. Drawing is an essential graphic expression for me which reveals how I perceive a surroundings and everything it contains. During the creative activity I have noticed that there are two ways to realize a language of images. The first one describes a technique and materials, how the illustration was made. Main aspects of analysis become these: a graphic style, lines, colors, shapes, characters, composition. A perceiver's eye reaches all that quite quickly. But — what really the artist aims to say by his artwork? That is why there is another much more important point how the illustration works and makes some feelings. This invisible thing takes a great role and is the main one to achieve a close relationship between the art work and the perceiver. Unseen part of the illustration has an impact on our emotions, changes an attitude to something we had known before in our own way and inspires us to find out something new about ourselves. And — the new story of the piece of art begins and becomes relevant individually. I love drawing, to create it with traditional and digital graphic techniques, seeing how it is born on a paper or screen. My inspiration for creativity is human, nature and their connection. It makes me feel free in creativity and fosters to create worlds inspired by my observations, feelings, experiences or even communication with people. I am working in the field of illustration and graphic design and love taking part in international contests. Also I create self-promotional projects, by making their narratives and showing my own perception of the world to others. I love sharing gained new practice and graphic expressions of my imagination, because I believe that it could inspire someone to encourage him to reveal his worldview and enrich a variety of creativity palette.",

Her illustrations are characterized by intricate and eye-catching details, whimsical compositions and colorful universes, plus some weird looking characters when the project allows to.

Her first series of drawings, “Sentimentos”, was the start of a subject she still explores. She believes that “art is a giant road that leads to self knowledge and gets you in touch with your deepest feelings and questionings”. The purpose of her work, whilst being deep and sensitive, is to give her viewers that same experience, inviting them to access their feelings in an intimate manner.",

Restlessly curious, he’s been involved in all kind of projects from graphic, industrial and interior design, to scenography, illustration, urban art or more recently 'cartelismo' (posters illustrator), under the statement of 'hazlo tu mismo' (literally 'do it yourself' implying no one will do it for you). Whenever touched by a social injustice, Garavato puts his illustration and muralism works to serve and support the cause in his own way. That’s how he’s been teaming up with organizations and collectives in Colombia, helping them standing for the rights of the victims after half a century of a national armed conflict. Passionate by the music as much as his art, he’s found a way to mix both by entering the gig poster world creating illustrations in silkscreens for music bands’ official merch, in collaboration with recognized Mexican collective 'Mercadorama'. He then cofounded C.ARTE.Latinoamericano and became an API member (American Poster Institute). To this day, he’s been officially illustrating for the following artists : Iggy Pop, Marky Ramone, Foo Fighters, , Queen Of The Stone Age, Primus, Café Tacuba, Gustavo Santaolalla, Natalia Lafourcade, LosPetitFellas, Café Tacuba...among others.",

By simply changing the thickness and curvature of the lines, Seymour creates an eye-popping 3D illustration. Each of his work exerts great control over line and symmetry.",

Being the best at drawing made him a hero at school, which is why, when a boring outing to the whale museum led to his creating a comic book called ‘Whale Bones’, it was met with praise and adoration instead of detention. Having recently moved over, he now lives in London with his home-girl Lucille, with the intention of getting a cat.

His latest projects include his first solo-show, “Rise of The Bird People” at Objectos Misturados Gallery in Portugal, the “Coffins” duo-show with Aitch at La Petite Mort Gallery, Ottawa, in 2014, and his second solo-show, “A Stranger in the Garden” at BC Gallery in Berlin.",

      "I’m self taught artist, based out of Saint-Petersburg, Russia. “His style is a mixture of predominantly black and white realistically rendered forms falling into a dreamlike darkness with minimal pops of color.” - Juxtapoz. “always awesome...” - SupersonicArt. “...Nikita’s works are almost hypnotic, if only for their surrealism. Looking at his illustrations is like peeking into a dream right as the dream-image begins to morph into its still-shapeless reiteration...” - Parallel Planets. “Gruing gothic, gorgeously occult, lines heavy, feeling worn; color limited and bracing when employed, Nikita Kaun’s grainy darks break to soft spells that seem to promise a new and special kind of light.” - thechromaticwatch.com",

Since this time he became modern nomad of everyday life, always on the move between Barcelona and Berlin, Paris and Biarritz. He is in an interdisciplinary journey between illustration and graphic design, two-and three-dimensionality. He believes illustration is no longer bound by the flat format, but very often inspects and develops space. With his projects he tries to build bridges between art and design, where illustration, painting, street & communication all play an important role. Joan illustrates his fantastic animal’s world and characters, holy scenarios filled with symbolism and curious lines and textures. A ritual atmosphere ready to melt with typography and endless traces of organic lines growing fanciful. He currently lives in Barcelona and keeps spreading his world through his studio taking part in art festivals, preparing new exhibitions and collaborating with brands and non corporate organizations.",

As a Designer, Ion Lucin solves problems, visual problems. He creates things that are minimalist and rational, less but more, and he does it in an unique and original style, all in 3D, but with 2D and bold look. Ion Lucin doesnt like to limit himself, hes creativity to just creative filed, he likes to explore, invent experiment and conquer new creative fields once he dominates the last one. He is in constant search of new creative projects, new ways to innovate and experiment, in order to create something new and never seen before, but always with hes unique and particular style. He is a designer, all of hes projects are created entirely only by him, he creates the project from concept to finished product. The creative fields he works are, Motion Design and Animation, Graphic Design, Typography, Illustration, Industrial Design, and all these are created entirely in 3D, because he is a 3D generalist.",

Magdiel decided to reveal his work in a series called “A Poster A Day” — releasing one piece of artwork on his Instagram everyday for 365 days. Each day garnered more attention from a global audience, ultimately leading Magdiel to be featured by the New York Times, Cosmopolitan, Entrepreneur, and Awwwards. To date, Magdiel has worked with several brands such as Apple, Nike, Absolute Vodka, MTV, Warner Brothers, etc., and currently has a partnership with Adobe as a design mentor and creative.
